# Salary Prediction Project

This project aims to predict the salary of workers based on various features such as age, gender, education level, job title, and years of experience. The prediction model is deployed using Streamlit and can be accessed [here](https://salarypredictx.streamlit.app/).

## Overview

The prediction model was developed using machine learning techniques to analyze a dataset containing information about workers' demographics, education, and employment details. The model predicts the salary of workers with a high degree of accuracy.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains the following columns:
- Age: Age of the worker
- Gender: Gender of the worker
- Education Level: Highest level of education completed by the worker
- Job Title: Title of the worker's job
- Years of Experience: Number of years of work experience
- Salary: Salary of the worker

## Steps Taken

1. **Data Collection**: The dataset was collected from [source].
2. **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset underwent preprocessing steps including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: EDA was performed to gain insights into the data distribution, relationships between variables, and identify any patterns or trends.
4. **Feature Engineering**: New features were created and existing features were modified to improve model performance.
5. **Model Selection**: Several machine learning algorithms were evaluated and the best performing model was selected based on evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
6. **Model Training**: The selected model was trained on the dataset using techniques such as cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to optimize performance.
7. **Model Evaluation**: The trained model was evaluated using appropriate metrics and validated to ensure robustness and generalization.
8. **Deployment**: The final model was deployed using Streamlit to create an interactive web application for predicting salaries based on user input.

## Achieving Optimal Solution

To achieve a predictive accuracy of 95%, the following strategies were employed:
- Careful selection of features: Relevant features were chosen based on domain knowledge and feature importance analysis.
- Model optimization: Hyperparameter tuning and model selection techniques were used to optimize model performance.
- Evaluation and validation: Rigorous evaluation and validation processes were conducted to ensure the model's accuracy and generalization.

## Future Improvements

- Integration of additional data sources to improve model performance.
- Fine-tuning of model parameters to further enhance accuracy.
- Continuous monitoring and updating of the model to adapt to changing trends and patterns in the data.
